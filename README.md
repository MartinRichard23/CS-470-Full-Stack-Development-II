# CS-470-Full-Stack-Development-II

## Experiences and Strengths:
### What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
#### In this class
### Describe your strengths as a software developer.
#### I would have to say my main strength as a software developer would have to be my problem solving skills. I have had a job where a lot of problems come up on a daily basis so I have had to adapt and overcome those challenges. I feel that has transfered over to my talents here. There are always going to be problems with software and finding a way to fix them and solve them is one thing I feel that I have been good at. This class had a few when it came to making the website and I was albe to solve them with a little hard work and elbow grease. 
### Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.
#### I feel this class has given me the skills to become any kind of developer. Whether that is front end, back end, or a full stack developer. I think I would have to lean more full stack developer as I liked to see the whole project come together in the end. From the design of the page to the full launch.

## Planning and Growth:
### Identify various ways that microservices or serverless may be used to produce efficiencies of management and scale in your web application in the future. Consider the following:
### How would you handle scale and error handling?
#### Scale with auto-scaling for containers or serverless functions, and distribute traffic with load balancers. Use retries, dead-letter queues, and monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch to manage errors.
### How would you predict the cost?
#### Predict costs using cloud pricing calculators, considering factors like execution time and resource usage for serverless, or provisioned resources for containers.
### What is more cost predictable, containers or serverless?
#### Containers are more predictable for steady workloads, while serverless is better for spiky or unpredictable workloads due to its pay-per-request model.
### Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion.
#### Serverless Pros and Cons: Serverless architectures simplify scaling and reduce operational overhead, making them ideal for rapid growth and unpredictable workloads. However, the pay-per-request model can lead to high costs if the application experiences continuous or high traffic.

#### Containers Pros and Cons: Containers provide greater control over resource allocation and are more cost-efficient for steady workloads, as you can provision resources to match predictable demand. On the downside, they require active management and may incur wasted costs if over-provisioned or underutilized.
### What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future growth?
#### Elasticity ensures scalability during demand surges, while pay-for-service aligns costs with actual usage, making both essential for efficient and cost-effective growth.
